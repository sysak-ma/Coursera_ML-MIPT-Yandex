7 | first time poster so sorry if this is too long but i ve hit a wall and don t know what else to try i m making a matrices calculator and doing so with c and wpf i ve been spending the last hour trying to figure out what s wrong with my array iterator to view and edit the values in a 2d nxn array to get a better idea my project so far requires the user to input a size n to make the array it ll generate a 2d int array of size nxn of 0 s and start at the default position of 0 0 from there the user can edit the value going from left to right top to bottom editing the whole array i have 2 private global ints one that keeps track of the row position and one that keeps track of the column position and manipulating these numbers to edit that part of the array the iterations starts off fine going 0 0 0 1 however instead of going from 0 1 0 2 like it should it jumps to 1 1 i ve gone countless times over my if logic and can t find where i m doing it wrong though i have yet to test the traversing back right to left bottom to top yet but since it s logic is nearly identical i m assuming it ll have the same problems i m currently having many thanks if someone could point me where in my logic it s flawed so i can move onto coding up the other parts my code is as follows private int matrix matrix currently being edited private int row keeps track of current row position and set to 0 when matrix is made private int col keeps track of current column position and set to 0 when matrix is made private void previouspos_click object sender routedeventargs e console writeline row + row + r n col + col if row lt 0 amp amp col lt 0 textblock1 text no previous values to edit row 0 col 0 positiondisplay text + col + + row else if row lt 0 amp amp col lt 3 setvalue row col valuedisplay text row 2 col 1 displaymatrix matrix positiondisplay text + col + + row else setvalue row col valuedisplay text row 1 displaymatrix matrix positiondisplay text + col + + row private void nextpos_click object sender routedeventargs e console writeline row +row+ r ncol +col if row gt matrix getlength 0 amp amp col gt matrix getlength 1 textblock1 text no more values to edit row matrix getlength 0 1 col matrix getlength 1 1 positiondisplay text + col + + row else if row gt matrix getlength 0 amp amp col lt matrix getlength 1 setvalue row col valuedisplay text col + 1 row 0 displaymatrix matrix positiondisplay text + col + + row else setvalue row col valuedisplay text row + 1 displaymatrix matrix positiondisplay text + col + + row public void setvalue int currow int curcol string value col currow row curcol try matrix row col int parse value catch exception string messageboxtext please input a valid number string caption warning messageboxbutton button messageboxbutton ok messageboximage icon messageboximage warning messagebox show messageboxtext caption button icon edit fixed a typo i saw and willing to post more rest of code on request

6 | i recently did some digging into memory and how to use it properly of course i also stumbled upon prefetching and how i can make life easier for the cpu i ran some benchmarks to see the actual benefits of proper storage access of data and instructions these benchmarks showed not only the expected benefits of helping your cpu prefetch it also showed that prefetching also speeds up the process during runtime after about 100 program cycles the cpu seems to have figured it out and has optimized the cache accordingly this saves me up to 200 000 ticks per cycle the number drops from around 750 000 to 550 000 i got these numbers using the qtestlib now to the question is there a safe way to use this runtime speedup letting it warm up so to speak or should one not calculate this in at all and just build faster code from the start up

6 | i have an application which uses a boost interprocess map in shared memory the map contains a large number of elements 100k to 10m and everything works pretty well with one exception the map has to be cleared periodically and this seems to take around 4 s per element so 40 seconds worst case which is unacceptable for the application it looks like clear actually deletes each map element individually and rebalances the tree after each deletion so it s horrendously inefficient when you have a large number of elements ideally clear would just delete all the elements without any rebalancing is there any way i can implement this kind of optimised clear method myself incidentally i ve also tried boost interprocess flat_map this has a much faster clear time as might be expected 10x faster but it s too slow for insert delete operations note an earlier question on stackoverflow touched on a similar problem with smaller stl maps in normal i e not shared memory but didn t really resolve the problem
7 | the documentation simply says readblock is a blocking version of read but what does that mean someone else has asked the question before but huh http www pcreview co uk forums thread 1385785 php the guy answering said basically it means that you can rely on streamreader readblock not returning until either it s read as much as you ve asked it to or it s reached the end of the stream am i understanding correctly that this is required because read may not give you everything you asked for and that just because it returns 0 does not mean you reached the end of the file so this means check something other than the number of bytes returned endofstream or use readblock instead

6 | decltype fails if the function you re calling it on is overloaded as in this code include lt iostream gt int test double x double y double test int x int y char test char x int y int main std cout lt lt decltype test lt lt std endl return 0 results error decltype cannot resolve address of overloaded function i understand that this is because decltype can t figure out which function you re trying to get the type of but why isn t there another way to make this work like this std cout lt lt decltype test double double lt lt std endl or this double x 5 y 2 std cout lt lt decltype test x y lt lt std endl since a function cannot be overloaded simply based on return type wouldn t passing either datatypes or actual variables to the decltype call be enough to tell it which of the overloads it s supposed to examine what am i missing here

3 | i have the situation that i need to numpy digitize an array say the code is my_bin_list 3 6 9 my_array np array 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 digitized numpy digitize my_array my_bins this works just fine however the problem is that i do not have one list of bins like in the example but exactly one bin list per element in my_array because each element belongs to a different dataset that has its own bins so that len my_array len list_of_my_bin_lists here is list_of_my_bin_lists my_bin_list1 my_bin_list2 so i need to tell digitize that for the first array element it should check into which bin of list_of_my_bin_lists 0 that element belongs for the second element with list_of_my_bin_lists 1 and so on is that possible i would imagine something like list_of_my_bin_lists 2 6 9 4 6 8 3 5 9 my_array np array 1 3 7 digitized numpy digitize my_array i my_bins i for i in len my_array which would have to return for digitized 0 0 2

3 | i m new to programming and i am trying to write a program that takes a positive integer n from input and then outputs all factorizations of n for example if n 10 the program would output 1 times 10 equals 10 2 times 5 equals 10 5 times 2 equals 10 10 times 1 equals 10 i believe the easiest way to do it is to use an if statement nested within for loops can anybody provide me with any guidance to help create this so far i have n int input a 0 b n for a in range 0 n if a b n continue if a b n print a+ times +b+ equals +n a a+1 b n 1 but for some reason it isn t working i think i have the right general idea but my code is obviously incorrect

6 | i need to compute a product vector matrix as efficiently as possible specifically given a vector s and a matrix a i need to compute s a i have a class vector which wraps a std vector and a class matrix which also wraps a std vector for efficiency the naive approach the one that i am using at the moment is to have something like vector lt t gt timesmatrix matrix lt t gt amp matrix vector lt unsigned int gt result matrix columns constructor that does a resize on the underlying std vector for unsigned int i 0 i lt vector size ++i for unsigned int j 0 j lt matrix columns ++j result j + vector i matrix getelementat i j getelementat accesses the appropriate entry of the underlying std vector return result it works fine and takes nearly 12000 microseconds note that the vector s has 499 elements while a is 499 x 15500 the next step was trying to parallelize the computation if i have n threads then i can give each thread a part of the vector s and the corresponding rows of the matrix a each thread will compute a 499 sized vector and the final result will be their entry wise sum first of all in the class matrix i added a method to extract some rows from a matrix and build a smaller one matrix lt t gt extractsomerows unsigned int start unsigned int end unsigned int rowstoextract end start + 1 std vector lt t gt tmp tmp reserve rowstoextract numcolumns for unsigned int i start numcolumns i lt end+1 numcolumns ++i tmp push_back matrix i return matrix lt t gt rowstoextract numcolumns tmp then i defined a thread routine void timesmatrixthreadroutine matrix lt t gt amp matrix unsigned int start unsigned int end vector lt t gt amp newrow newrow is supposed to contain the partial result computed by a thread newrow resize matrix columns for unsigned int i start i lt end + 1 ++i for unsigned int j 0 j lt matrix columns ++j newrow j + vector i matrix getelementat i start j and finally i modified the code of the timesmatrix method that i showed above vector lt t gt timesmatrix matrix lt t gt amp matrix static const unsigned int num_threads 4 unsigned int matrows matrix rows unsigned int matcolumns matrix columns unsigned int rowseachthread vector size num_threads std thread threads num_threads vector lt t gt tmp num_threads unsigned int start end all but the last thread for unsigned int i 0 i lt num_threads 1 ++i start i rowseachthread end i+1 rowseachthread 1 threads i std thread amp vector lt t gt timesmatrixthreadroutine this matrix extractsomerows start end start end std ref tmp i last thread start num_threads 1 rowseachthread end matrows 1 threads num_threads 1 std thread amp vector lt t gt timesmatrixthreadroutine this matrix extractsomerows start end start end std ref tmp num_threads 1 for unsigned int i 0 i lt num_threads ++i threads i join vector lt unsigned int gt result matcolumns for unsigned int i 0 i lt num_threads ++i result result + tmp i the operator+ is overloaded return result it still works but now it takes nearly 30000 microseconds which is almost three times as much as before am i doing something wrong do you think there is a better approach edit using a lightweight virtualmatrix following ilya ovodov s suggestion i defined a class virtualmatrix that wraps a t matrixdata which is initialized in the constructor as virtualmatrix matrix lt t gt amp m numrows m rows numcolumns m columns matrixdata m pointertodata pointertodata returns underlyingvector data then there is a method to retrieve a specific entry of the matrix inline t getelementat unsigned int row unsigned int column return matrixdata + row numcolumns + column now the execution time is better approximately 8000 microseconds but maybe there are some improvements to be made in particular the thread routine is now void timesmatrixthreadroutine virtualmatrix lt t gt amp matrix unsigned int startrow unsigned int endrow vector lt t gt amp newrow unsigned int matcolumns matrix columns newrow resize matcolumns for unsigned int i startrow i lt endrow + 1 ++i for unsigned int j 0 j lt matcolumns ++j newrow j + vector i matrix getelementat i j and the really slow part is the one with the nested for loops if i remove it the result is obviously wrong but is computed in less than 500 microseconds this to say that now passing the arguments takes almost no time and the heavy part is really the computation according to you is there any way to make it even faster

4 | i am attempting to use the exhibit pattern in a padrino application but to do so properly i need to access the rendering context that is i need to have some object context such that calling something along the lines of context render accounts index will produce identical output to when render accounts index is called from inside a controller assuming that all variables are set the same and that app views accounts index erb is a template file i can t find anything that does this within the padrino public api so i attempted to dig deeper the existing render method in the controller wraps sinatra s render method which is a private instance method so it s not obviously not defined on the class myapp i e the padrino application subclass myapp new results in an instance of rack session cookie rather than of itself and none of the padrino methods that i can find return the existing instance of the app which would be a suitable candidate for the context object if i called its private render method is this something that s just inherently too difficult to bother with given sinatra s and padrino s designs or is there something that i m missing here

5 | i am currently working on a grid based game map prototype each tile is 24px by 24px and the script draws out 31 x based tiles and 21 y based tiles for a total of 651 tiles on the screen the problem i m having is that the way i have my script going it s making a database call for every single tile that s drawn at every page refresh meaning it s making 651 database calls to check what the tile is and the coordinates of the tile to me this seems obscenely inefficient the x and y coordinates are stored in a session variable when the user clicks one of the directional buttons below the map it offsets the appropriate coordinate accordingly and redraws the map if i were to create a game based on the logic i m using and playing the number game let s hypothetically say i ve got 100 players playing the game at any one time and they re all browsing through the map i would have 65 100 database calls simultaneously that can t be good for system resources i am not a noob when it comes to php mysql programming as i have created and launched a few different browser based games however this is my first venture into generating a map and navigating around it the tile map can be viewed here http fordserver com gamemap the actual code for this can be found here http fordserver com gamemap index txt can anyone recommend a good way to get this running more smoothly you ll notice that when using one of the directional buttons that the game can take quite awhile to generate the actual map especially if you are just visiting it for the first time i ve tried to think of different ways to use arrays and everything else but really the game needs to check the database for each individual tile as i plan to incorporate functions so that it shows where a specific user currently is or a building etc i appreciate any help i can get with this ricky

2 | i have tried to configure declarative transaction management within my spring based web application and it refuses to cooperate with me i have two main problems setting defaultautocommit to false on our datasource which we need for our application causes all queries to rollback with or without transactions being involved transactions are configured and proxy classes as well as transactional methods are created however no transactions appear to be used the first problem is rather perplexing as every individual query is being rolled back in the database this includes select statements as well what could cause every query to be rolled back in the database as for the second problem my configuration of the transaction management is outlined below applicationcontext xml lt xml version 1 0

that i have visited in trying to solve this problem i believe that my configuration should be correct however i do not fully understand aop and spring transactions so i may be missing something crucial as alluded to above i can trace through my logs and see proxies as well as transactional methods being created for my service classes however when i actually run the application and trace through the logs i don t see any statements dealing with the datasourcetransactionmanager or transactions being created committed rolled back etc it would appear to me that nothing is actually being run and i am terribly confused as i have followed many different tutorials and tried this many different ways but it always ends up with this situation i am also fairly certain that i have my log4j properties set up correctly to receive messages from the datasourcetransactionmanager but i am supplying them below to make sure that it is not just a logging error on my part my log4j is set up with the following loggers to try and trace through the transactions log4j logger org springframework info file log4j logger org springframework jdbc datasource debug file log4j logger org springframework transaction debug file note i ran the top logger on debug at one point and that is where i verified that the service proxies were being created does anyone have any insights into what might be happening i am rather stuck at the moment as i do see some parts involved with transactions being created but i don t see any signs of any transactions being used whatsoever edit additional information as requested by jb nizet my entire application is annotation driven and so my service beans are annotated with service and injected into my controllers via name based autowiring the below

1 | i want to build a simple banner image slider functionality but instead of sliding the images are supposed to fade in and out it s a drupal project so i don t know how many images are going to be used the structure is simple enough lt div class banner container gt lt potentially a lot of divs with background images gt lt div gt what i want to do is essentially iterate through this array of divs let the currently active one fade out and let the one that the array is pointing to at the moment fade in i thought i could get it to work like this var a banner container children while 1 a each function active fadeout 500 removeclass active this fadein 500 addclass active obviously there is a lot wrong in my code i have run into multiple issues but the one i cannot seem to solve is getting the loop to wait between the iterations to my knowledge a traditional loop like foreach could just have some sort of wait function added to the end of it and execute that wait in every loop but the each seems to execute every iteration simultaneously how can i loop through an array like this potentially infinitely and wait like 5 seconds every time i read somewhere that the animate functions work asynchronously and i assume the same goes for css transforms so creating fadein and fadeout classes and try this with css wouldn t work

1 | what would be the advice on starting and organising a library of useful code based on the jquery library im thinking of starting this for all of the code that i use alot and ends up just being copied and pasted between projects i would like to have all of this functionality included in some sort of library of plugins any ideas or best practices in this area edit a lot of advice here is with regards to creating plugins thats proving to be helpful although what i was really interested in is how to organise all of the plugins in one placce where i can simply call any piece of functionality whenever its required
1 | i m trying to design a map using images that overlap in an isometric format right now i have 2 different designs each one fixes the other s issue here is the current setup http mc1 empirebattles com map maplayout html the display on the left has issues with the vertical overlap and the display on the right has issues with the horizontal overlap i know that the reason is due to the fact that when a z index is applied to the parent container the subsequent z indexes applied to the children is localized inside the parent but i still need the row effect to span across the multiple parent divs i know one solution is to just not assign a z index to the parent divs and just assign ascending descending z indexes to each row but in the final product the parent divs will be created dynamically and i m trying to avoid having to do calculations at each row for relative z index i cant think of any other way to do it though anyone else have any ideas on how to apply z index relatively

7 | is there a way to specify the port for a httpcookie i have a site that is available at sub example com and needs to be deployed at sub example com 81 and sub example com 82 so the same domain different ports using apache2 and mono the authentication is done by using cookies specifying the domain and path sub example com domain sub example com path sub example com 81 domain sub example com 81 path sub example com 82 domain sub example com 82 path seems that the port in domain is not used all works fine for sub example com but when logged on sub example com the page at sub example com 81 also receives the authentication cookie set by sub example com so i want to be able to specify also the port to a httpcookie to restricts the ports to which this cookie may be sent or maybe there is a workaround to simulate this

6 | i m looking at some code and think the whole logic doesn t make sense here it seem quite poor to have a macro like this as an example i use this macro twice and i get both strings to output testing hello testing world the preprocessor simply replaces the identifier with the block of code it is the same as copy pasting the code so shouldn t the compiler give a redefinition error for firstpass if using this macro multiple times if you manually paste in main static bool firstpass true multiple times the compiler will give an error if firstpass is static it is created and initialized only once so using this macro multiple times shouldn t produce any results besides the first use since the flag was set to false yet it still does cout every time a bit confused define testing input static bool firstpass true if firstpass std cout lt lt input firstpass false

2 | i need to generate a href to a uri all easy with the exception when it comes to reserved characters which need percent encoding e g link to some path element should appear as lt a href some path 3belement gt i know that path element represents a single entity initially i was looking for a java library that does this but i ended up writing something myself look below for what failed with java as this question isn t java specific so rfc 3986 does suggest when not to encode this should happen as i read it when character falls under unreserved alpha digit _ class so far so good but what about the opposite case rfc only mentions that percent always needs encoding but what about the others question is it correct to assume that everything that is not unreserved can should be percent encoded for example opening bracket does not necessarily need encoding but semicolon does if i don t encode it i end up looking for first when following lt a href first second gt but following lt a href first second gt i always end up looking for first second as expected what confuses me is that both and are in the same sub delims class as far as rfc goes as i imagine encoding everything non unreserved is a safe bet but what about seoability user friendliness when it comes to localized uris now what failed with java libs i have tried doing it like new java net uri http site pa th null toasciistring but this gives http site pa th which is no good similar results observed with javax ws rs core uribuilder spring s uriutils i have tried both encodepath string string and encodepathsegment string string first is a result of call to httpservletrequest getservletpath in the server side when clicking on lt a href first second gt edit i probably need to mention that this behaviour was observed under tomcat and i have checked both tomcat 6 and 7 behave the same way

1 | sencha touch seems like an amazing way to develop mobile apps i ve seen posts by people incorporating jquery d3 at the same time the posts describing customizing controls seems to be fairly narrow adding the picture of a kitten next to the slider and labeling the slider seems kinda tame compared to what ios can do in terms of custom controls at least in terms of examples available most blog posts imply you can extend the control objects in sencha or the css file these posts are not quite what i m looking for that s my problem i can t see any examples of anyone changing default controls in sencha touch but they make it sound as if it might be possible to do anything this is my question is sencha touch able to build an ios or android app incorporating any javascript library or html5 are there any limitations here to give an example i trying to implement a custom slider where a touch along a continuous line or a circle like this color selector will enter new values further if you incorporate a library like protovis or d3 or raphael charts can sencha display anything the graph canvas element will otherwise display will it take touch input and interact with the graph libraries the way that the html5 graph does
6 | all this seems like a simple problem but it s giving me fits lets say i have a c++ base class called animal and derived classes cat dog horse hippo snake i have another class called zoo that contains a list qt list in this case where the base class animal is a qobject of animal objects now what i want to do is create a zoo object and be able to copy it to another zoo object and have the destination zoo have it s own copy of the animals the problem is in the zoo copy constructor because it thinks it has a list of animals it calls the copy constructor for animal instead of dog cat etc as compilers are ought to do to get around this i changed the animal list to be a list of animal pointers and then created my own animal copy constructor and assignment operator each of these calls the animal clone animal amp rhs method that in turn calls each derived class of animals clone method that returns a new pointer allocated from the heap with a copy of its data this all works fine but i keep thinking that i m missing a more elegant solution so my question is when you have a container with objects of a type how do we copy the class that contains the container i hope that makes sense

7 | i have an app that uses some code scripts to generate dll s at run time and invoke them as needed and have run into some questions before i go ahead and code it is it possible to unload them from memory when not needed if not what would be the performance impact of loading them into separate appdomains and invoking the calls using some ipc etc btw this needs to be highly performant real time alternatively how about loading multiple instances of the generated assembly with different version s of course i d assume if you release all references not being used it might be unloaded by the gc framework also a q would there be any collisions not sure if this is the right word in this scenario

4 | i m attempting to use a ruby on rails application to look through and visually organize dependencies as of now i ll be using the maven dependency tree plugin however if my understanding of this is correct i cannot run mvn dependency tree in a ruby script on someone else s computer so the pom files project must be local the only idea i ve come up is to pull the entire github repository into the rails app which i haven t been able to find a way to do this problem 1 secondly that would take a long time but that doesn t matter for my purposes are there better ways to do this that i m just missing in my research

1 | my project consists on creating a freecell game using html 5 canvas and javascript i currently have a partially working game but the code started getting very messy thus i started refactoring it and i identified some behavior that i could centralize in objects i have an interface called cardcontainer which holds cards in the game and the classes which implement it are freecell homecell and stack which are the temporary cell the stack where i put the cards out of the game and the initial stacks where i work with the cards during the game respectively two relevant methods on this interface are push cards card for stack it has one or more cards inside and for the others it has only one card pop quantity integer card for stack it returns the quantity amount of cards but for the others it returns always one i see that my design is wrong here because some of the clients of my interface will simply ignore the quantity parameter on the pop method on the other hand if i change this interface for something more consistent e g with or without parameter depending on the client i will introduce a code smell of downcasting where i would be always checking the type of the client here first of all i don t know how do i formulate this question in more generic terms how can i fix this design to at the same time get rid of the parameter for unnecessary clients and avoid downcasting edit i have a move method which receives a source and destination which share the interface cardcontainer

6 | i have two static libraries and one macos app all under latest xcode 8 1 1 first lib a is objc++ mixed objc and c++ stl 2 second b is pure objc and contains some common categories for nsobject for example 3 the app is swift and use both libs all targets builds with the same c++ flags libc++11 and so on the problem is 1 if i add objc and or load_all linker flags to the app to normal linkage with lib b categories then i got many undefined symbols for architecture x86_64 all about stl 2 if i remove this linker flags then app compile normal but in runtime i v got missing selector for all lib b categories however if i completely remove lib b adding all of its sources directly in the app and respectively remove objc load_all then the problem with the stl linking is solved but unfortunately this is not the right option for me so i hope for your help or at least an explanation of thanks

8 | i am prototyping a meta model on top of proto3 to generate domain specific boilerplate as the go proto3 extension syntax is ridiculously expressive my domain proto files depend on meta proto which contain the extensions i can compile the these to go when including the meta proto file the generated go ends up with the following include block import proto github com golang protobuf proto import fmt fmt import math math import google_protobuf google protobuf lt this import does not exist my extension file has the following structure based off this syntax proto2 package option go_package import google protobuf descriptor proto lt this causes the import message myextensionclass message myextensionfield extend google protobuf messageoptions optional myextensionclass class 50000 extend google protobuf fieldoptions optional myextensionfield field 50001 i know the solution is likely very simple the google protobuf include is meant for c++ generation in my workspace the included package should be github com golang protobuf protoc gen go descriptor

3 | i m working on estimating distance from stereo cameras i am using python 2 7 11 and opencv 3 1 versions i calibrated every camera separately and found intrinsic parameters the problem is that when i use cv2 stereocalibtare function in the way stated in opencv documents i get the error typeerror cameramatrix1 is not a numerical tuple the code looks like this stereo_criteria cv2 term_criteria_max_iter + cv2 term_criteria_eps 100 1e 5 ret_stereo r t e f cv2 stereocalibrate objpointsl imgpointsl imgpointsr grayl shape 1 mtxl distcoeffl mtxr distcoeffr criteria stereo_criteria flags cv2 calib_fix_intrinsic i thought that changing the camera matrix into tuple using tuple function might work it didn t change anything and then i thought the problem might be the version of opencv that i m using so i changed it into 2 4 13 but that didn t change anything also after all these tries i thought i let the stereocalibrate do the camera matrix and distortion coefficient estimation itself without any single camera calibration the code looked like this stereo_criteria cv2 term_criteria_max_iter + cv2 term_criteria_eps 100 1e 5 stereocalib_retval cameramatrix1 distcoeffs1 cameramatrix2 distcoeffs2 r t e f cv2 stereocalibrate objpointsl imgpointsl imgpointsr grayl shape criteria stereo_criteria but it gets an error saying typeerror required argument distcoeffs1 pos 5 not found i just can t figure out why this function is not working all i want is to calculate the r t e f values update for the last error i tried this stereocalib_retval cameramatrix1 distcoeffs1 cameramatrix2 distcoeffs2 r t e f cv2 stereocalibrate objpointsl imgpointsl imgpointsr mtxl distcoeffl mtxr distcoeffr image_size criteria stereocalib_criteria flags stereocalib_flags and it worked although putting cameramatrix1 distcoeffs1 cameramatrix2 distcoeffs2 were not needed and are actually equal to mtxl discoeffl mtxr discoeffr respectively omitting them was causing error for me the first problem still remains i appreciate your help masood saber
6 | disclaimer i know an answer to this question i thought it might be of some general interest question how can we have a type trait that produces the type that results from performing default argument promotions motivation i would like to be able to use variable arguments portably for example void foo char const fmt please pass unsigned short bool char32_t unsigned char when passing arguments to a function call without parameters i e matching the ellipsis the arguments undergo default argument promotion so far so good but those promotions are platform dependent i can recover the arguments with va_arg ap t but what is t now for some simple situations this is easy for example i can always say unsigned short n va_args ap unsigned int the default promotion will result in either a signed int or an unsigned int but according to say c11 7 16 1 1 3 va casting to unsigned int is always fine since even if the default promotion results in an int the original value can be represented by both types but what type should i cast to when i expect a char32_t c++11 4 5 2 leaves the resulting type wide open so i would like a trait that lets me write char32_t c va_args ap default_promote lt char32_t gt type how to do this bonus points for a trait that produces a static assertion when the parameter type must not be passed as a variable argument
7 | i am trying to setup a list of items in wpf which contains strings of random length people s names the majority of them are generally within a certain size but occasionally you come across a string so long that it runs out of the bounds of it s container i ve normally just truncated it when it s too long but i would much rather show the entirety of the string how can i force the text to remain it s normal size unless too big to fit in which case scale it down to fit note this is not the same as scaling all text to fit a certain size which is accomplished using a viewbox around the text ie this is not what i want lt viewbox maxwidth 100 gt lt textblock text binding employeedisplayname updatesourcetrigger propertychanged horizontalalignment left verticalalignment center gt lt viewbox gt this makes everything scale up when too small as well as scale down when too big i only want it to scale down when too big and never scale up when too small any thoughts

2 | i d like to send via the udp protocol one single datagram at a fixed rate every 30ms or so i managed to do that with ease using three classes timer scheduledthreadpoolexecutor and handler all three approaches had the same issue everything works well then suddendly a sender thread freezes for a few seconds then datagrams are send quicker than they should every 10 15ms and then everything goes back to normal for about a minute then the whole process starts again i m not really sure how should i fix it is it a gc that makes my thread hang or maybe there is nothing i can do here and i should implement some kind of buffer on a receiving device edit after a few days of trying a number of different solutions i ve managed to solve my problem but in a very peculiar way the trick was to send datagrams at a fixed rate of 10ms so much more frequently than i need i m not really sure why it works but it does i tested this solution on three different routers and as many phones i had access to this is not a perfect way of solving my problem and i d love to know a better way to do so but for now it will do

3 | some discussion in another question has encouraged me to to better understand cases where locking is required in multithreaded python programs per this article on threading in python i have several solid testable examples of pitfalls that can occur when multiple threads access shared state the example race condition provided on this page involves races between threads reading and manipulating a shared variable stored in a dictionary i think the case for a race here is very obvious and fortunately is eminently testable however i have been unable to evoke a race condition with atomic operations such as list appends or variable increments this test exhaustively attempts to demonstrate such a race from threading import thread lock import operator def contains_all_ints l n l sort for i in xrange 0 n if l i i return false return true def test ntests results threads def lockless_append i results append i for i in xrange 0 ntests threads append thread target lockless_append args i threads i start for i in xrange 0 ntests threads i join if len results ntests or not contains_all_ints results ntests return false else return true for i in range 0 100 if test 100000 print ok i else print appending to a list without locks is unsafe exit i have run the test above without failure 100x 100k multithreaded appends can anyone get it to fail is there another class of object which can be made to misbehave via atomic incremental modification by threads do these implicitly atomic semantics apply to other operations in python is this directly related to the gil

6 | i want to write an asynchronous timer that calls a function after a certain amount of time has passed now i want to be able to bind a function using boost bind with any signature that the timer calls after a certain interval has passed the way i do it right now is inspired by boost thread which has sort of an abstract baseclass to store the threaded function this is what i do class timedfunctionbase public virtual void call 0 typedef std shared_ptr lt timedfunctionbase gt timedfunctionbaseptr template lt class f gt class timedfunction public timedfunctionbase public timedfunction f _f m_function _f void call m_function private f m_function then inside the timer function i simply save the callback as follows myasynctimer private timedfunctionbaseptr m_callback and call it inside the timed function with m_callback gt call my question is actually pretty simple does boost already provide a mechanism to do this after a long search i could not really find much and the internals of boost thread also looked as if there is nothing predefined for this kind of use maybe boost function_base the docs say that you may not create it directly is there a boost way or do i have to write these container classes myself

6 | so just as a back story to what i ve done so far and what i want to achieve currently i m using a whole heap of singleton classes to pass my instances around which is going to become a very bad idea very soon as i m looking into multithreading and have heard more like read that singletons can become evil and a huge problem when multithreading is involved in my main init class i ve got code that initialises an window renderer and a surface sdl2 i m wanting to break the code down so that i ve got a class that handles only the window code same with the renderer and surface too i m looking for ways if they re possible to make an instance of a variable which will hold say the primary window and then be able to access said variable without using a dedicated function e g in the init function of window bool window init m_primarywindow sdl_createwindow creation info here if m_primarywindow sdl_loginfo info primary window created return true else sdl_logcritical critical could not create primary window n s sdl_geterror return false as you can see normal right well say i create a window class in game i d have to add a function such as sdl_window primarywindow window getprimarywindow to get that instance but that s not what i want i want to create only one sdl_window variable in window and reference to that in a function that uses a string maybe eg sdl_window window getwindow std string id so that in game i could just init and show the window and then call the instance like window m_window m_window getwindow primarywindow so that i can use that instead of constantly creating sdl_window variables all over my code same needs to be done with the renderer too edit ok so i ve made the following changes and it works but i can t access the values within the mapped structure window hpp typedef struct sdl_window window const char title int width int height int flags m_windowstruct typedef std map lt std string m_windowstruct gt m_windowmap window cpp bool window init if createwindow window creation variables here return true else return false bool window createwindow std string id const char title int width int height int flags m_windowmap windowmap m_windowstruct windowdata windowdata window sdl_createwindow title sdl_windowpos_centered sdl_windowpos_centered width height flags if windowdata window windowdata title tile windowdata width width windowdata height height windowdata flags flags windowmap gt insert m_windowmap value_type id amp windowdata sdl_loginfo info window creation successful return true else return false so i guess my question now is how would i grab the window pointer from the struct within the map also as a side note how would i then destroy the pointer once i m finished

1 | good afternoon in my timezone i want to compare two dates one of them is inserted by the user and the other is the present day snippet of code var datestring 2012 01 03 var date new date datestring date lt new date true false this returns true i think under the hood both date objects are transformed to milliseconds and then compared and if it is this way the today object is bigger because of the hours and minutes so what i want to do is compare dates just by the day month and year what is the best approach create a new date object and then reset the hours minutes and milliseconds to zero before the comparison or extract the day the month and year from both dates object and make the comparison is there any better approach thanks in advance with the best regards happy new year

6 | i am attempting to implement a cloth simulation using a spring particle system but something isn t quite right with my physics when i run the simulation the cloth draws as expected but over time the force of gravity pulls the cloth downward indefinitely in other words the forces caused by the springs are not accumulating properly to overcome the downward pull of gravity and i end up with this it continues to droop downwards indefinitely from all of the debugging i have done what i have seen is that the accumulation of forces on a particle caused by all of the springs attached to it is not properly summing when the force of gravity causes increased stretch i can not figure out what i have overlooked in my physics my cloth updates every time step using this function void cloth updategeometry atlas utils time const amp t for int i 0 i lt msprings size ++i msprings i calculateforces for int i 0 i lt mparticles size ++i mparticles i updategeometry t my springs update using the

as you can see the totalspringforces in the y direction has positive value of 0 7037 i e is counteracting gravity i let it run for half an hour and it only got to 5 currently my constants are k 2 0f

2 | i ve inheirited support for a legacy web app which is directly using the internal apache xerces classes within the rt jar i think the history is that this code back in java1 4 used to explicitly use xerces and at some point when moving to java5 use of the xerces jar was dropped and those classes were referenced out of rt jar as the internal equivalents i m trying to understand what the impact of running this project on various web containers will be e g websphere versus tomcat etc is rt jar supplied by sun or the jvm jre vendor do alternate vendors continue to use xerces internally or are there other xml implementations at some point resource permitting this code will need to be changed to use the standard java apis i was want to get a handle on how big a problem this might be thanks rob

7 | description i am creating a simulator for different resolutions basically i have a control inside a panel then the user can choose an aspect ratio more information below and the control inside the simulator should get resized to match the desired ratio problem the problem is that i do not know what is a good way to calculate the size of the control without having to use a lot of cpu or trying or resizing how can i know if i have to resize the height or the width of the control to fit inside the simulator the simulator can grow or shrink that is why i can not be sure if the control inside of it will fill up the whole width of the simulator or the height but the aspect ratio should be always correct hint this is probably a very easy mathematical problem i just don t find a solution right now today is not my day if you have any ideas or suggestions feel free to ask and propose example available resolutions 3 2 like on the iphone until iphone 5 anyone knows an other name 16 10 wxga 16 9 widescreen 4 3 vga thanks for helping

6 | this is kind of a beginners question but i haven t done c++ in a long time so here goes i have a class that contains a dynamically allocated array say class a int myarray a myarray 0 a int size myarray new int size a note that as per mikeb s helpful style critique no need to check against 0 delete myarray but now i want to create a dynamically allocated array of these classes here s my current code a arrayofas new a 5 for int i 0 i lt 5 ++i arrayofas i a 3 but this blows up terribly because the new a object created with the a 3 call gets destructed when the for loop iteration finishes and this means that the internal myarray of that a instance gets delete ed so i think my syntax must be terribly wrong i guess there are a few fixes that seem like overkill which i m hoping to avoid creating a copy constructor for a using vector lt int gt and vector lt a gt so i don t have to worry about all this instead of having arrayofas be an array of a objects have it be an array of a pointers i would think this is just some beginners thing where there s a syntax that actually works when attempting to dynamically allocate an array of things that have internal dynamic allocation also style critiques appreciated since it s been a while since i did c++ update for future viewers all of the answers below are really helpful martin s is accepted because of the example code and the useful rule of 4 but i really suggest reading them all some are good succinct statements of what s wrong and some point out correctly how and why vector s are a good way to go

1 | i am experiencing what seems to be a traditional problem for node js beginners and async requests i have an unknown number of urls generate by the user and subsequently stored in an array on my node js server the node js server must iterate through these urls making a request to each one in turn it must do so in order and it must wait for each response before moving onto the next url when a new request will be made the final result should be the in order collection of all the responses which happen to be json nicely stored together as a json object which in turn can be sent back to the client when ready i think i should use the async nodejs library and i am already using needle for making the requests urls http a http s http d async eachseries urls function url callback i m not clear how to use async to ensure that the needle request has finished and store that response accordingly before moving onto the next url request below is an example of my needle request needle get url options function error response body either a partial or complete solution to the whole problem is welcome

3 | i m working with an existing schema about combat data in a video game because i have to work with data generated by an external program this schema isn t technically compatible with how i want to organize the data but it mostly works one problem that comes up 3 times so far is providing the user with a big table of data to browse search through to start sifting through the data that s available so i decided to have a single generic way of generating a data table and handling ajax requests for more data to that table the problem is that one of these cases is basically retrieving data straight from a table while another is actually retrieving summarized data from a table for example the schema defines a combatant or a participant in a combat but i want the system to expose a concept of a character or a thing that exists and participates in many combats so a character would be a combatant in multiple different encounter s there s basically two ways i can create the idea of a character from the database i can either use a view or i can have my orm sqlalchemy create the required query from scratch every time view support is possible in sqlalchemy via some possible extensions but because i m summarizing i lose the primary key and therefore i can t create an orm class representing the view supposedly you can force a column to be a primary key but that didn t work for me seemed to do nothing if i try to use the query from scratch my current way of generating a generic table doesn t work for want of being able to inspect a query result so i have two questions and a mcve for the query from scratch approach am i taking an approach to this problem known to be bad is there a way to avoid using inspect that lets me use arbitrary strings to get values from a query result object some notes about the mcve i ve stripped down the number of orm objects the columns in each and the config information in the column lists the column lists are ugly in their original form where the double nested for loops are in the mcve there s a templating system in my actual code web server generating html all the usual fun has been stripped out to focus on sqlalchemy

10 | when we re constructing our app s view controller view architecture i believe i m using that word correctly as it concerns the relationships of objects and how they work together and what roles they play rather than what frameworks we use etc the view is a uiresponder and it receives touch events the view controller also receives those touch events but view controller is a controller object and responding to touch events is controller logic so the view controller should be responsible for knowing what to do depending on which view is touched right so is it better practice to put all the touch logic in view controller objects and not put it in the view object essentially ignoring the fact that views can respond to touches if we put all the logic in view controller objects is it a good idea to have a view controller object for each view that needs a fair amount of touch logic so instead of one view controller with a bunch of subviews as interface elements containing all the touch interaction code we have each sub view be the main view of its own view controller object and have all those view controllers be children of a parent view controller is that a good approach thanks for your help

3 | i was wondering if there was a way to insert multiple variables into a list at one time using the same index so for example let s say we have a list of a b c and 0 1 2 3 4 and i wanted to insert the first list such that the end result is a 0 1 b 2 3 c 4 but if i was going to do it individually using list insert pos value and used the positions of 0 2 4 then the subsequent positions used becomes invalid since it was relating to the old list of 5 elements instead of 6 now any suggestions

6 | how does compiler ms visual c++ 2010 combine identical string literals in different cpp source files for example if i have the string literal hello world n in src1 cpp and src2 cpp respectively the compiled exe file will have only 1 hello world string literal probably in the constant readonly section is this task done by the linker what i hope to achieve is that i got some modules written in assembly to be used by c++ modules and these assembly modules contain many long string literal definitions i know the string literals are identical to some other string literals in the c++ source if i link my assembly generated obj code with the compiler generated obj code would these string literals be merged by the linker to remove redundant strings as is the case when all modules are in c++

4 | my problem comes with the navigation links endless scrolling i have included a delete button for each micropost when that button is pressed there s an ajax call to the server and the micropost is deleted and the div is removed from the dom say that i had microposts 1 to 10 on the first page microposts 11 to 20 on the second etc say that i delete items 1 2 and 3 on the first page then scroll dowmn the server will recalculate the microposts since i removed 3 of the previous list it will return items 13 to 22 in other words microposts 10 11 and 12 don t appear on the first page nor the second after hunting around on stackoverflow i found a solution whenever i delete a micropost from the list i load the micropost that came right after the last micropost on the page and inserted it at it at the bottom how i m currently going with the fix by default i show 10 microposts on a page using the will_paginate gem i need to know the id of any micropost displayed at any given time i achieve this by storing it in the opening div tag of for the container that holds each micropost lt microposts each do m gt lt div class postholder data micropost id lt m id gt gt i access it like this in my microposts js assets file function message_delete on ajax success function event data status xhr console log data to check if json is working console log postholder last data micropost id here is my controller destroy action def destroy micropost micropost find params id respond_to do format micropost destroy format json render json gt micropost just to check if json is working end end now i know the id of each micropost so when one is deleted i use a jquery selector to fine the last postholder div on the page get the id and then use that id to get the micropost that comes after it and insert that micropost after it this way when a message is deleted one is automatically appended if the user happens to scroll to load more messages none are missing i ve watched some railscasts and see ryan bates do similar things with using data attributes and have read a few things about them and seem to get the impression this is bad practice i ve tried to come up with other ways of doing this but can t think of any but doing it this way feels slightly strange maybe it s all in my head but i would like another better solution if possible thanks kind regards

1 | so i have an array the array has string values inside that can change each time var array 1 2 3 4 5 or sometimes var array 1 4 3 4 4 or even var array 1 3 3 4 4 how would i go about iterating through this array figuring out which value is present the most and then displaying it also how would i go about making it even smarter to understand that sometimes there is a tie between two values as is the case in the last array above and then displaying info notifying me that values 3 and 4 are tied or if there is no value that occurs more than once thus displaying all values thoughts

1 | in my angular application i am using an ng repeat and inside each a child controller with a form for each item i m also using a debounce so that i can auto save the data but the issue is that after saving the data with restangular the changes are not propagated back up to the array in the parent a simple example will work using angular copy but this has issues with restangular and its replacement restangular copy does not function exactly the same way i also tried explicitly setting the item to the right index on the array but it causes my cursor to lose focus in the input here is a simplified version of my child controller s code and here is a full js bin is there another approach to solve this problem scope personcopy angular copy scope person debounce and auto save changes scope watch personcopy function newval oldval if newval amp amp newval oldval if timeout timeout cancel timeout timeout timeout saveperson 1000 true var saveperson function in my real app the following is inside a save callback method 1 doesn t work at all scope person scope personcopy method 2 works with angular copy but not restangular copy angular copy scope personcopy scope person method 3 works but cursor loses focus scope people scope index scope personcopy

4 | i have a script that outputs urls based on input data each line of input generates roughly 20 urls this output is then used to upload to akamai content control however akamai has a limit on file size set to 50kb i know i can write a url and then check file size if file size breaks buffer close that file and create a new one and repeat i am ultimately curious if there is a far more elegant way to handle this within ruby with less overhead code thanks

7 | i m trying to implement a stereo camera calibration app using emgu cv my problem is when i try to use cvinvoke cvremap to undistort an image the function just hangs no errors or crashes it just hangs and i ve left it for 2 hours in case it was just being slow here s what i m doing capturing 10 pairs of chessboard samples left and right making sure findchessboardcorners works on each i m not doing anything special to sync the cameras just capturing them at the same time generate set of object points based off the chessboard used doing a separate calibratecamera on the left and right images of each sample using the object points from 2 and the image points from 1 doing a stereocalibrate using the intrinsiccameraparameters generated by calibratecamera in 3 the object points in 2 and the image points captured from the chessboards in 1 doing a stereorectify using the intrinsiccameraparameters from 3 4 generating mapx and mapy for both left and right from cvinitundistortrectifymap using output from 5 attempting to cvremap using mapx and mapy from 6 and fresh images captured from the cameras next use stereobm findstereocorrespondence and pointcollection reprojectimageto3d to generate a point cloud from my hopefully calibrated stereo data so when i get to 7 cvremap just hangs i ve gotton cvremap to work capturing from a single camera though so i know

2 | i am working on a java web application that is many years old most of the lt bean write gt s in the jsps have filter false even when it isn t needed probably because of developers blindly copying existing code lt bean write gt is the struts tag to output a jsp variable and when filter false is specified it does not do html escaping so filter false is similar to the lt c out gt attribute escapexml false this means that the application is vulnerable to xss attacks because some of these lt bean write filter false gt s are outputting user input a blanket removal of filter false isn t an option because in some cases the application allows the user to enter html using a tinymce text area so we do need to output raw html in some cases to retain the user entered formatting although we should still be sanitising user entered html to remove scripts there are thousands of filter false s in the code so an audit of each one to work out whether it is required would take too long what we are thinking of doing is making our own version of the bean write tag say secure write and doing a global find replace of bean write with secure write in our jsps secure write will strip scripts from the output when filter false is specified after this change users would still be able to cause formatting html to be output where they shouldn t really be able to but we aren t worried about that for the time being as long as the xss vulnerabilities are fixed we would like to use a library to implement the script stripping in the secure write tag and we have been looking at https www owasp org index php category owasp_antisamy_project and https code google com p owasp java html sanitizer both look like they are capable of sanitising html although antisamy looks like it is intended to be used to sanitise html on the way in to the application instead of on the way out and since data is output more often than it is input we are concerned that running all of our secure write output through it could be slow i have 2 main questions 1 will our proposed approach work to fix the xss vulnerabilities caused by filter false 2 can anyone recommend a library to use for html sanitisation when displaying content i e which is fast enough to not significantly affect the page rendering performance has anyone used antisamy or owasp java html sanitizer for something similar

5 | i installed some failed request tracing in iis 8 5 on windows server 2012 to try and analyze why some page loads take longer than others we have a situation were sometimes a page will load in a few seconds and then other times it will take 20 seconds to process so i was hoping that i could use frt to help me analyze those times when it takes a long time this question here is very similar but it does show a little bit of time whereas mine doesn t and my issue isn t related to transfer time at least not between iis and me this isn t just static html these pages are dynamically generated by php which in turn is making a call to a database to retrieve information i was hoping to discern the differece between the time taken by iis or php but my log files all show 0 time take or 0 duration for each element of the frt a bit of shotgunning on my part because i don t know exactly which section would report on what i am after but here is my config content all conditions time 2 which is gt 2 if i read the help file correctly trace providers isapi extensions verbose www server verbose for www server i have marked each of the areas the php is coded such that it also is reporting the amount of time it takes that is telling me it is taking 6 8 seconds in certain conditions this is a test file designed for this purpose so it does 50 queries reporting the entire time back sometimes though there is a single query in that run that takes 15 20 seconds to process while the frt log does log a trace it will say that the time taken was only 2 532s as an example even though the php and wall clock say that it was 6 8 seconds but again looking into the details of the frt log it only shows 0 for the time taken regardless of how long it really took what i would really like to see is how long a php call is taking iis is having to wait for that to finish before it returns results so its seems like that would be logged thanks justin
6 | i m trying to use curl from within my windows c++ app but keep running into problems i m using visual studio 2013 on a windows 8 1 machine here s what i ve done so far cloned the repo from github built the libcurl project which produced three files libcurl dll libcurl_imp lib and libcurl_imp exp in my app project i added the curl include directory to the additional include directories added the libcurl_imp lib to the additional dependencies built my project when i run my executable it says the program can t start because libcurl dll is missing from your computer i found a few things on it but they solved it by adding the libcurl dll along with the exe which isn t what i m looking for as i want my executable to contain the libcurl so that it will work on machines without the need to have the dll any ideas thanks edit the 2nd step is done pretty much straight forward i just right clicked on the project libcurl and chose buiild due to the comments i ve rebuilt it after changing the configuration type to static library so now it only produces one file libcurl dll which as far as i know not a static library 2nd edit i wasted too much time on getting http functionality and based on the info which i found thanks to a comment here using libcurl without dll i ve decided to abandon this approach and i found something which suits my needs perfectly and is simple to install use c++ rest sdk codename casablanca

2 | my scenario filter a java collection such a frequent scenario and i am seeking the best methodology to do so after some searching in stackoverflow i can only see recommendation of specific collection filtering method without statistical comparsions for speed somebody recommended predicate some recommended lambdaj i would like to see if somebody studied that already so the question is what is the best way to filter a java collection in terms of readability and speed scope i would like to know the study result of some remarkable methodology in the web they are in certain if you have another better choice feel free to edit my question while looping collectionutils predicate lambdaj cqengine possible performance study details we may assume there is a ws call which need 0 05seconds to execute and we may call it for 100 times getsomething 0 05 seconds to execute then we may compare their performance in scenarios like single result performance assume there is only one result returned by certain criteria when the object is found quit the searching 1 1 best case scenario 1 2 worst case scenario 1 3 average case scenario multiple result performance assume there is a collection returned may more than one result thanks for answering

7 | i have a wpf applications that runs on 2 000 pcs xp vista win 7 win 8 and the only thing it does is to show new notifications taken from a main server at the moment everything works trough pooling and it is hard for the server to handle that load i m now required to provide the same service to another customer which has 4 000 pc so pooling is no longer an option the customer wants also to be able to specify which active directory group should receive the notification and every notification must been received by the client even if offline at the time it will receive it when back online security is not an issue i m searching for the best architecture suited for the task this is what i have considered so far 1 wcf msmq discarded it requires msmq active on every client machine 2 wcf nettcpbinding publish subscribe https msdn microsoft com en us library ms752254 v vs 110 aspx it would be perfect but how i m supposed to handle different groups should i check the group of the user and based on that subscribe it to a different topic 3 keep all clients always connected to the server on connect the client sends it s domain name to the server the server associate a connection to a user and keep looping trough all the connections while sending notification when available for that user i m not sure how many connections i m able to always keep opened should i use wcf or just make my own sockets system the logic is pretty basic but it needs to be available on multiple windows platforms with different net version do i still need the clients to send back an ack when received a notification or i can just trust the tcp ack any suggestions will be much appriciated
6 | i am implementing a task runtime system that maintains buffers for user provided objects of various types in addition all objects are wrapped before they are stored into the buffers since the runtime doesn t know the types of objects that the user will provide the wrapper and the buffer classes are templated template lt typename t gt class wrapper private t mdata public wrapper default wrapper t amp user_data mdata user_data t amp getdata return mdata template lt typename t gt class buffer private std deque lt wrapper lt t gt gt items public void write wrapper lt t gt wd items push_back wd wrapper lt t gt read wrapper lt t gt tmp items front items pop_front return tmp now the runtime system handles the tasks each of which operates on a subset of aforementioned buffers thus each buffer is operated by one or more tasks this means that a task must keep references to the buffers since the tasks may share buffers this is where my problem is 1 each task needs to keep references to a number of buffers this number is unknown in compile time 2 the buffers are of different types based on the templeted buffer class 3 the task needs to use these references to access buffers there is no point to have a base class to the buffer class and then use base class pointers since the methods write and read from the buffer class are templeted and thus cannot be virtual so i was thinking to keep references as void pointers where the task class would look something like class task private vector lt void gt buffers public template lt typename t gt void addbuffer buffet lt t gt bptr buffers push_back void bptr template lt typename t gt buffer lt t gt getbufferptr int index return some_way_of_cast buffers index the problem with this is that i don t know how to get the valid pointer from the void pointer in order to access the buffer namely i don t know how to retain the type of the object pointed by buffers index can you help me with this or suggest some other solution edit the buffers are only the implementation detail of the runtime system and the user is not aware of their existence

1 | using scope in a directive introduces an isolate scope which does not prototypically inherit from its parent scope but i have always used it for a different reason a convenient way to declare html attributes with two way data binding scope attr1 attr2 to get a non isolate scope you have to use scope true which does not offer the opportunity to declare such attributes i now find myself needing a directive with a non isolate scope but with two way binding what s the best way to achieve this example my use case is something like this in the view of the outer directive lt div ng repeat e in element gt lt inner directive two way attr e value gt lt inner directive gt lt div gt but inner directive is in the same module as outer directive it doesn t need to be encapsulated with an isolate scope in fact i need to use scope inheritance for other purposes so an isolate scope is not an option it s just that using an html attribute to establish this two way communication is extremely convenient

8 | i have a function that takes an interface and returns an interface it would like to initialize the result to a copy of the source then make some changes and return the result for example playground type something interface copysomething something i d like to get rid of this setx x int type realthing struct x int func t realthing setx x int t x x func t realthing copysomething something newt t return amp newt func updated original something newx int something newthing original copysomething i d like to make the copy without copysomething newthing setx newx return newthing func main a amp realthing x 1 b updated a 5 fmt printf a v n a fmt printf b v n b this works but the copysomething method seems unnecessary and i d need another identical method for every interface that needs to copy things is there a better way to make a copy of original inside of updated without an extra method is there some more idiomatic way to achieve this in the specific case i m working on i could get away with just instantiating a new instance of the same type as original i don t really need the copy is the problem any simpler that way based on evan s comment i thought i d give some of the other reflect based things i ve already tried newthing reflect new reflect typeof original compile error type reflect value has no field or method setx newthing reflect new reflect typeof original interface something runtime error interface conversion main realthing is not main something newthing reflect indirect reflect new reflect typeof original interface something runtime error invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference at this point i felt my reflect was becoming silly and stopped just whacking at it
